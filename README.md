# STR-Sequencing

Short tandem repeat (STR) analysis is a common molecular biology tool used to compare repeats at specific loci in DNA between two or more samples. A short tandem repeat is a microsatellite with repeat units that are 2 to 7 base pairs in length, with the number of repeats varying among individuals. 

This tool can be used to identify the exact number of repeats of each STR within a DNA sequence, and match it to a database of individual DNA sequences and their known STR numbers. As such, this is an especially very useful forensic tool, which can take a sequence of any length and match to known human sequences.
