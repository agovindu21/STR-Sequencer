# STR-Sequencing
This sequencing tool leverages short tandem repeats (STRs), allowing users to take DNA sequences of any length and match them to a database of known human DNA samples. This is an especially useful and forensic tool, and is very often used for human identification purposes.

# Background
Short tandem repeats (STRs) are commonly repeating DNA satellites, with repeat units that are 2 to 7 base pairs in length. Because the number of repeats varys among individuals, STR analysis is a common molecular biology tool used to compare STRs at specific loci in DNA between two or more samples.
